Overview:   
  This a group project we were tasked to do in our data structuers class. We had to create a Huffman Tree from some text
  and then determine the correct encoding of 1's and 0's. Right now It writes the 1's and 0's as a string of characters, 
  which doesnt actuall compress the text but it allows for the user to easily understand waht is going on. In the future, 
  implentation of writing the 1's and 0's to a binary file will be included.
