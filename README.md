Huffman Tree

NOTE:   
    If you are a collaborator and would like to make changes, please create your branches from the Dev-Stage branch. Also, all pull requests should be to the Dev-Stage first, that way we can do any testing needed.

Overview:   
    This a group project we were tasked to do in our data structures course. We had to create a Huffman Tree from some text and then determine the correct encoding of 1's and 0's. Right now it writes the 1's and 0's like a string of characters to a file, which doesn't actually compress the text but allows for the user to easily understand what is going on. In the future, the implementation of writing the 1's and 0's to a binary file will be included.

  
Note on Data Structures:    
    We ended up using a doubly-linked list to create the tree, but this can also be done with a priority queue.
